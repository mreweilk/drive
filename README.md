# drive

A simple nginx/apache style directory listing for a Google Drive account

To use:

Rename drive/settings_blank.py to drive/settings.py and modify:

```
CLIENT_SECRET_FILE
 - This should be credentials generated by the Google Drive api python example
ROOT_ID
 - ID from Google Drive of the folder you wish to be your root directory
SITE_URL
 - Full url where your site will live
ALLOWED_HOSTS
 - Set your domain name
```


A simple uwsgi config:

```
[uwsgi]
plugins = python27
master=1
processes = 1
max_request = 25
env = DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=drive.settings
chdir = /directory/of/drive
module = drive.wsgi
socket = /tmp/site.socket
```

Hosting it with nginx:

```
upstream driveindex {
   server unix:///tmp/site.socket;
}

serverblock {
   location /drive/ {
      uwsgi_pass driveindex;
      include /etc/nginx/uwsgi_params;
   }
}
```
